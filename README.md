# PyBer_Analysis
##Overview and Purpose
PyBer, a ride-sharing app company, wants us to analyze and pull out answers from all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 
Once that step is done, we are creating a compelling visualization for the CEO, V. Isualize

#Results: (differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types):
-The average number of rides in the rural cities is about 4 and 3.5times lower per city than the urban and suburban cities.
-From the combined box and whisket plots,the average fare for rides in the rural cities is about $11 and $5 more per ride than the urban and suburban cities
-The average number of drivers in rural cities is nine to four times less per city than in urban and suburban cities

#Summary: 
Because of the low number of rides in rural cities, we recommand increasing fare bonuses, to encourage drivers to work in rural cities.
This way, we can witness an increase in driver's number and have a more balanced drivers spread in all the cities
